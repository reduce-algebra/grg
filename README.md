# **GRG**

## Computer Algebra System for Differential Geometry, Gravitation and Field Theory

---

## Introduction

The computer algebra system **GRG** is designed to make calculation in differential geometry and field theory as simple and natural as possible. **GRG** is based on the computer algebra system **REDUCE** but **GRG** has its own simple input language whose commands resemble short English phrases.

**GRG** understands tensors, spinors, vectors, differential forms and knows all standard operations with these quantities. Input form for mathematical expressions is very close to traditional mathematical notation including Einstein summation rule. **GRG** knows covariant properties of the objects: one can easily raise and lower indices, compute covariant and Lie derivatives, perform coordinate and frame transformations etc. **GRG** works in any dimension and allows one to represent tensor quantities with respect to holonomic, orthogonal and even any other arbitrary frame.

One of the key features of **GRG** is that it knows a large number of built-in usual field-theoretical and geometrical quantities and formulas for their computation providing ready solutions to many standard problems.

Another unique feature of **GRG** is that it can export results of calculations into other computer algebra system such as _Maple_, _Mathematica_, _Macsyma_, or **_REDUCE_** in order to use these systems to proceed with analysis of the data. The _LaTeX_ output format is supported as well. **GRG** is compatible with the **REDUCE** graphical shells, providing book-quality output with Greek letters, integral signs, etc.
